# Build a portfolio with Sheetson and VueJS
## What are we going to build?
We will build a simple portfolio website that has header, portfolio items and footer. The data is loaded from a Google Sheet using Sheetson.

To get started, please make a copy of this Google Sheet and follow our [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide. You also need to register at [sheetson.com](https://sheetson.com) and get an API ready.

## What do we need before we get started?

 - A computer
 - A text editor

 Yes, that's it.
